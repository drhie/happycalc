#HappyCalc
This app is deployed at the following address: http://happycalc.herokuapp.com

This is a calculator web app meant to reinforce lessons pertaining to JavaScript interactivity, DOM manipulation and AJAX requests. All the work is done through requests made with $.ajax, and the calculations happen almost entirely through JavaScript and JSON. Since much of my interest thus far has been in back-end development, this was also an attempt at improving my front-end skills, particularly with Sass, and becoming a more skilled front-end developer.

FURTHER THINGS TO BUILD ON:

1) Include more variety of data in the calculator results.

2) Add more JavaScript interactivity.
